# Celeste Classic Mobile

*Touch controls and offline-cache for CELESTE Classic*


## [Live Demo!](https://celestemobile.github.io)

Open it on your smartphone, it works fine :)

NOTE: The controls use touch events, so they are not shown on desktop. If you wish to view the controls on desktop, you can simulate tough events with Google Chrome's developer tools.

## Mods

Also supports some high quality mods made by the community:
- [Adelie](https://celestemobile.github.io/adelie)
- [Old Site](https://celestemobile.github.io/oldsite)

Check out the [original game](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145) on the Lexaloffle BBS.


## About and why

[PICO8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is the perfect fit for mobile devices - with it's small resolution, input restrictions and good performance. The square screen leaves enough space for touch controls.

The existing HTML-export, however, doesn't come with touch controls. Also, the touch controls provided on the PICO8 site itself never really worked for me.
