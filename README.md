## About and why

[PICO8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is the perfect fit for mobile devices - with it's small resolution, input restrictions and good performance. The square screen leaves enough space for touch controls.

The existing HTML-export, however, doesn't come with touch controls. Also, the touch controls provided on the PICO8 site itself never really worked for me.
